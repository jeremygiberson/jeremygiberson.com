#A new blogging platform

So, `jeremygiberson.com` has been down for a while, since I accidentally canceled its' hosting account. 

I finally got around to standing something back up in its place. What you see now is a new blogging platform written from scratch with Slim framework (RC 3). 

Now I don't have an excuse for not blogging. 

I'll fill some content by talking about what I learned with this little exercise. 

*Spoiler: micro-frameworks are neat*
