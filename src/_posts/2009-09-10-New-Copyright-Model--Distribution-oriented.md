#New Copyright Model: Distribution oriented

Recently watched a discussion on copyright model issues [HAR Panel](https://vimeo.com/6128124) from [TorrentFreak](https://vimeo.com/user2174020). 

Below I describe my naive approach to a "fair" copyright model. I think this model provides the right balance between distribution and protecting the author's rights.

### A new copyright model 

  1. Once created, any work automatically becomes copyright by the author.
  2. Copyright ownership does not, nor cannot transfer. Ownership exists from the time of the work’s creation to the death of the author.
  3. Copyright affords the right of the author to a monetary percentage (based on the ratio of contribution in collections of work) of any income directly attributed to the usage or distribution of owned work. The default percentage amount is 25%. However, the author of copyrighted work may enter in to contracts with distributors that alter the default percentage.
  4. Copyright does not grant the right to specify who can or cannot distribute work or for what amount the work is distributed.
  5. Copyrighted work can be obtained, used, or distributed for free–so long as no monetary gain is resulted from that material.

The goal of this copyright model is meant to open up copyright material in a fair and reasonable way to any party.

### Benefits for the author

Being as copyrighted material can no longer exclusively be held and distributed authors open up more sources of distribution and thus more opportunity for profit on their work. Authors have the comfort of know that they are entitled to a percentage of any profit made in part by contribution of their copyrighted material and as such have a legal channel to enforce that right.

### Benefits to education

Educators no longer have to worry about finding material for their curriculum that fits a budget. Any material can be obtained by the instructor and made available to the students. Either by making it available on the course home page, or passing out fliers during class. Educators are also free to make a profit by comprising there own compendium of works for the course curriculum that students must purchase from the book store (as is done already) with the simple stipulation that the regulated percentage of the price go to the authors of the the material featured in the collection.
### Benefits for business (Small and Large)

Being as no person or company can obtain exclusive distribution rights, as a company you have the opportunity to obtain and distribute copyrighted material that is doing well in a desire to join in on profiting from said work.

Large companies have the benefit of having a bargaining chip with the author to allow them to distribute copyrighted work at reduced distribution percentage by offering highly available distribution. (IE Sell a lot, for a little).

Small companies have the benefit of competing with large companies by capitalizing on the creative freedom of the distribution model. For example, creating start up web sites with subscriber downloadable content. Since copyrighted material doesn’t have a set in stone base price, they can choose to offer as little or as much content via subscription or pay per download to create a competitive pricing model against large physical media distribution companies.

### Individual usage benefits

Because monetary issues only come into play on profiting off of distributed material, obtaining material is a lot simpler. For one, due to the competitive nature of capitalistic markets, you’re going to find material provided cheaper and far more easier to obtain.

Due to the nature of the distribution license, all material is potentially freely available. Only a single person, possibly starting with the author himself, is needed to seed the initial distribution of material for free. Once you (or any person) gets a hold of copyrighted material (either by paying for it or by obtaining it for free) you are free to pass the material on to as many or as few people as you want (either for free or for a fee [so long as you pay the author a percentage of the profit]). A site like pirate bay (that is NOT add supported, or subscription supported, or money involved) is totally legit. Pirate bay itself becomes legit simply by paying the authors of the content distributed by its site a percentage of ad revenue.

The only issue here is determining what percentage of distribution any material represents, how much total revenue was generated and passing forward the author’s royalty percentage.

### Examples

You release a compilation album of 10 songs by 10 different artists at $100 dollars. Regardless what the cost of producing the album is, you are selling it for $100 dollars. $100/10 = $10 per artist for revenue base. Multiplied by the distribution royalty percentage of 25% , $10 * .25 = $2.50. Each artist is entitled to $2.50 for each album sold. Variations of this example involve a single artist for more than one song, plus contractual stipulations reducing the distribution royalty percentage.
