#Out of the Tar Pit

Found a great paper: [Out of the tarpit](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf).

_Out of the Tar Pit_ talks about the sources of complexity in software development. It redefines complexity imbued in the domain problem (*essential complexity*) and complexity that arises from implementation, performance or other constraints (*accidental complexity*).  Then goes on to describe some sources of accidental complexity and offers means for how best to isolate accidental complexity from the system.



Key Takeaways:

* There are two kinds of complexity in software development: **accidental complexity** and **essential complexity**.
* **Essential Complexity** is the complexity inherit in the problem space.
* **Accidental Complexity** is the complexity that arise from implementation, performance and other constraints
* Avoid accidental complexity where possible.
* Separate essential complexity
